										<h2>Course Summary</h2>
									</header>
									<p>
										What is ChatGPT doing under the hood? How do Large Language Models work? What are they capable of? What are their potential pitfalls and even dangers? In this course, Our goal will be to gain a high-level understanding of contemporary language technologies. Through critical inquiry, example-based learning, and hands-on investigation, we will find insight into the fundamentals of how computers are used to represent, process, and produce natural language text and speech. We will cover the theory and practice of human language technology. Topics include statistical (pre neural networks) language models, vector semantics, machine learning for classification, AI and education, and other topics determined by student interest. By the second half of the semester, armed with the basic principles of text processing, we will be ready to tackle LLMs. <strong>Class Project:</strong> Throughout the semester, we will work towards building our own classification dataset and use this dataset to train and evaluate a model for a task we design together.<br />
<br />
This is NOT a coding course. There are NO math pre-requisites; we will cover the basics in probability and linear algebra that the course requires. (Linear algebra is just arithmetic with batches of numbers at a time). We will pay special attention to the human side of language technologies: the pragmatics of interaction, the relation between culture and language.<br />
<br />
However, the course goes beyond merely using AI systems. It emphasizes analysis and reasoning to draw and argue for valid conclusions about the design, capabilities and behavior of natural language systems. A foundation of computational and logical thinking skills is invaluable for understanding the human side of technologies. Demystifying AI is the first step in understanding ourselves to be subjects capable of transforming a world increasingly saturated with AI, rather than just consumers of AI. Therefore, assignments and assessments are designed to build basic skills in formal and computational analysis. The course philosophy is to ground abstract concepts in real world examples. Evaluation will be based on the midterm, homeworks, participation, and discussion questions.<br />
<br />
Before the flag system was abolished, this class had a quantitative reasoning flag. However, this is no longer a strict requirement. If you want to read ten books and write a research paper about the environmental and economic impacts of building AI data centers in Texas, (or build a program to rewrite song lyrics based on craigslist ads), go for it! I will support self-guided projects as best I can. Together, we can figure out a plan to measure progress towards a goal you want to work towards.

										<h2>Learning Outcomes</h2>
									</header>
									<p>By the end of this course, students will be able to:</p>
									<ul>
										<li><strong>You will be able to explain what kinds of problems have to be solved in order for computers to do useful things with language.</strong> In order to train a computer to perform a human language task, we first have to understand something about how human language works and what kinds of problems need to be solved.</li>
										<li><strong>You will learn how to approach tasks from a computational perspective.</strong> This is not a programming class, but through class exercises and homework, you will gain experience thinking like a computer scientist and about how a computer scientist would go about solving problems in human language.</li>
										<li><strong>You will gain insight into the technology that underlies a wide variety of human language technologies, from spell checkers to search engines to dialogue systems.</strong></li>
										<li><strong>You will gain experience thinking about data.</strong> Data science is one of the fastest growing fields for graduating college students. Throughout this class, we will think about the nature of experiments and data.</li>
										<li><strong>You will gain a better understanding of the ethical considerations around work in computational linguistics.</strong> We will spend time not just on the primary research, but on thinking about the higher-order ethical and practical considerations that impact computational linguistics as a field.</li>
									</ul>

								<!-- Readings -->
								<section>
									<header>
										<h2>Readings</h2>
									</header>
									<p>Readings will draw from various sources. Everything will be digitally available through Canvas, the UT library, or this website. We will draw pretty heavily from two books in particular.</p>
									<ul>
										<li><strong>Artificial Intelligence: A Guide for Humans</strong> (Farrar Girou, & Strauss 2019) by cognitive scientist Melanie Mitchell (Santa Fe Institute). A very accessible, math-free introduction to AI that doesn't shy away from the details. Published just shy of the LLM era, it can already sound a little outdated. Mitchell is a strong reminder of what AI can't yet do. When read today, the book takes on a naïve charm. Still, it is an important bit of reason amid the AI hype, from someone who has been significant in the field for decades.</li>
										<li><strong>Speech and Language Processing</strong> By Dan Jurafsky and James Martin (UC Boulder). The current gold standard NLP textbook.  This text is written for computer science students. It is dense, and gets technical at times. Therefore, where Mitchell covers a topic I will assign that chapter instead, (but I'll still link you to J&M for optional further reading.<strong> Note:</strong> Make sure you use the copy I link you to which is the most up to date draft of 3rd edition.</li>	
									</ul>
									<p>The 'math free' Mitchell isn't dumbed down–it's deeper. Mitchell's ability to explain technical topics without resorting to esoteric symbols and formalisms is rare and invaluable. The more you (as a student) are able to explain technical topics in terms of concrete examples and experience, the stronger the foundation of intuition you build, and the better you are set up for creative reasoning about those topics. Use the mitchell to understand what is happening. Use J&M for nuts and bolts. </br>

								<!-- University Policies -->
								<section>
									<header>
										<h2>University Policies</h2>
									</header>
									<h3>Academic Integrity</h3>
									<p>Each student in the course is expected to abide by the University of Texas Honor Code: "As a student of The University of Texas at Austin, I shall abide by the core values of the University and uphold academic integrity." Plagiarism is taken very seriously at UT. Therefore, if you use words or ideas that are not your own (or that you have used in previous class), you must cite your sources. Otherwise you will be guilty of plagiarism and subject to academic disciplinary action, including failure of the course. You are responsible for understanding UT's Academic Honesty and the University Honor Code which can be found at the following web address: <a href="https://deanofstudents.utexas.edu/conduct/standardsofconduct.php" target="_blank">https://deanofstudents.utexas.edu/conduct/standardsofconduct.php</a></p>

									<h3>Sharing of Course Materials is Prohibited</h3>
									<p>No materials used in this class, including, but not limited to, lecture hand-outs, videos, assessments (quizzes, exams, papers, projects, homework assignments), in-class materials, review sheets, and additional problem sets, may be shared online or with anyone outside of the class unless you have my explicit, written permission. Unauthorized sharing of materials promotes cheating. It is a violation of the University's Student Honor Code and an act of academic dishonesty. I am well aware of the sites used for sharing materials, and any materials found online that are associated with you, or any suspected unauthorized sharing of materials, will be reported to Student Conduct and Academic Integrity in the Office of the Dean of Students. These reports can result in sanctions, including failure in the course.</p>

									<h3>Notice about missed work due to religious holy days</h3>
									<p>A student who misses an examination, work assignment, or other project due to the observance of a religious holy day will be given an opportunity to complete the work missed within a reasonable time after the absence, provided that he or she has properly notified the instructor. It is the policy of the University of Texas at Austin that the student must notify the instructor at least fourteen days prior to the classes scheduled on dates he or she will be absent to observe a religious holy day. For religious holy days that fall within the first two weeks of the semester, the notice should be given on the first day of the semester. The student will not be penalized for these excused absences, but the instructor may appropriately respond if the student fails to complete satisfactorily the missed assignment or examination within a reasonable time after the excused absence.</p>

									<h3>FERPA and Class Recordings</h3>
									<p>Class recordings are reserved only for students in this class for educational purposes and are protected under FERPA. The recordings should not be shared outside the class in any form. Violation of this restriction by a student could lead to Student Misconduct proceedings.</p>

									<h3>Academic dishonesty policy</h3>
									<p>You are encouraged to discuss assignments with classmates. But all written work must be your own. Students caught cheating will automatically fail the course. If in doubt, ask the instructor.</p>
